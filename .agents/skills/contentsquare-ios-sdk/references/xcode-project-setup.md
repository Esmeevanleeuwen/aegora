# Xcode Project Setup

## ⛔️ CRITICAL RULES & ENVIRONMENT CHECKS

Before performing any Xcode setup or file manipulation, you **MUST** adhere to the following rules. A hefty fee will be applied if you violate them.

### 1. The Anti-Ruby Mandate
You are **strictly forbidden** from using Ruby, Rails, or any Ruby gems (including the `xcodeproj` gem). Under no circumstances may you write or execute Ruby scripts.

### 2. Modern Xcode Folder Synchronization
Modern Xcode projects support folder synchronization. When adding new source code (`.swift`) or resource files, simply write them to the correct directory on disk. They will be automatically included in the Xcode project. **Never manually modify the `.pbxproj` file to add files.**

### 3. Allowed Scripting Languages
If you absolutely must write a script to manipulate the project environment (e.g., configuring SPM packages beyond what the provided `xcode_spm_setup` script does), you **must use Swift**. Only as an absolute last resort, if Swift is completely unviable, may you use Node.js or TypeScript.

### 4. Toolchain Verification
Because this skill relies entirely on a native Swift script, you must verify the environment:
- Run `swift --version` before proceeding.
- If the Swift command is not found, you must stop and recommend the user install the Swift toolchain (e.g., via `xcode-select --install` on macOS), or ask if you can attempt to install it for them. Do not attempt to proceed without Swift.

## Empty Directory Workflow

If you are asked to build an iOS app or configure Xcode dependencies but **no `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` exists**, you MUST ask the user to create the project first:

**"No Xcode project found in this directory. Please create an empty Xcode project manually and let me know when you are ready to proceed."**

Wait for the user to confirm they have created the `.xcodeproj` via Xcode, then proceed with the Standard Xcode Workflow below.

## Standard Xcode Workflow

Do not use raw text parsing, `sed`, or Ruby scripts to modify `.pbxproj` files directly.

Instead, execute the Swift configuration package bundled with this skill (`scripts/xcode_spm_setup`) to securely install SPM packages.

### **CRITICAL: Always Use Latest SDK Version**
To ensure access to the latest features and security fixes, always use the most recent version of the Contentsquare iOS SDK. Check for the latest release version at [https://github.com/ContentSquare/apple-sdk/releases](https://github.com/ContentSquare/apple-sdk/releases). 
- Use the most recent version number (e.g., `1.x.y`) in your commands instead of hardcoded placeholders.

### Understanding the Script's Actions
When adding a Swift Package to an Xcode project, two distinct steps must occur:
1. Adding the package repository dependency (e.g., `https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire`).
2. Selecting the target (e.g., `MyApp`), navigating to **General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**, and hitting the `+` button to explicitly link the specific product modules (e.g., `Alamofire`).

**The provided `xcode_spm_setup` Swift script automatically handles BOTH of these steps for you.** By passing the list of modules as arguments, it safely injects the package dependency and automatically wires those modules to the main target's Frameworks build phase. You do not need to do any manual linking.

## Usage

1. **Locate the package path:** Find the absolute path to this skill's `scripts/xcode_spm_setup` directory on disk.
2. **Execute:** Run the native `swift run` command using the signature below:

```bash
swift run --package-path <PATH_TO_SKILL>/scripts/xcode_spm_setup xcode_spm_setup <ProjectPath.xcodeproj> <RepoURL> <VersionRequirement> <Product1> [Product2 ...]
```

### Example 1: Generic Package (e.g., Alamofire)
Adding Alamofire to a standard Xcode project.

```bash
swift run --package-path /Users/foo/.agents/skills/xcode-project-setup/scripts/xcode_spm_setup xcode_spm_setup MyApp.xcodeproj https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire 5.8.1 Alamofire
```

Example 2: Contentsquare
```bash
swift run --package-path /Users/foo/.agents/skills/xcode-project-setup/scripts/xcode_spm_setup xcode_spm_setup MyApp.xcodeproj https://github.com/ContentSquare/apple-sdk 1.11.0 ContentsquareSDK
```

*Note: It will upgrade the packages that are already present in the project.*
